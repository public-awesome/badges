# Badge NFT

The `badge-nft` contract is an implementation of the Stargaze's [SG-721](https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/tree/main/packages/sg721) interface. Based on [sg721-base](https://github.com/public-awesome/launchpad/tree/main/contracts/sg721-base), It uses a modified approach for handling metadata that reduces the usage of on-chain storaga space.
